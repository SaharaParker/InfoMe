  <h1>Quick Intro</h1>

  <p>Hi, my name is Sahara Parker. I was born and raised in Boston. I've lived here my <strong>entire</strong> life (except for the six months I lived in Tennessee back in 2017).
    I like art in all forms, animals, baking, writing, astrology, exercising (sometimes), character design, and any game that allows for character creation. I also like tv and movies (especially horror).</p>

    <h2>The Sims</h2>

    <p>Oh, man. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sims">The Sims</a> is <em>definitely</em> the main thing that got me into computers, and just games in general. My first Sims game was The Sims on Playstation 2. That was good, but when I got
    The Sims Complete Collection on PC, I was <strong>hooked</strong>. I've been playing since 2001, and haven't stopped. What got me the most was the creation aspect. Creating unique 'sims'(which is What
    the people in the game are called), building their homes, and giving them their own stories. What makes the game on PC so much better than the console versions is that you can download mods and
  custom content made by other sims players, usually for free. Custom Content makes the game look a lot better, as the sims tend to look a bit cartoon-y (I prefer a more realistic look). Mods,
which I believe involve coding, add more gameplay to the sims and more features. When you think you've done it all, add a mod! I played the sims the most in highschool, which was a tough time for me. I struggled
in class and in my home life. The Sims was a way for me to create my own stories, and give myself everything I wanted. Sometimes, I'd just play The Sims to create sims, then exit the game. As a teenager,
I used to have a youtube channel where I made music videos using the sims. </p>

<h2>Astrology</h2>

<p>I haven't been into astrology as long as I've been into The Sims, but it's a long-term interest nonetheless. I got into astrology in middle school, due to my interest in people. My mother had a red
book that listed every birthday, a description of the person born that day, compatibility with other zodiac signs, and a lot more. I've always had an interest in people and the way
we look, think and act. What makes us different? What makes us similar? After getting the gist of the sun signs, I jumped right into synastry charts. A synastry chart is taking the natal charts
of two people, and overlaying them to see the relationship between those two people. It can show challenges the two may have, and qualities that can bring them together. I don't use astrology
to predict (though some people like to), but to reflect what is already happening. I wanted to view my relationships with my family, friends, and even school crushes to see how we'd connect. Around
2013, I started to look at my natal chart to understand myself more. It's so interesting to look back on my life, and see where I was affected by my natal chart. A <strong>natal chart</strong> is
just where the planets were located when you were born. I never really talk about this interest, because a lot of people do make me feel ridiculous for being interested in it. I've
noticed it's becoming a bit more known on social media, so I've started to feel a bit more comfortable.</p>

<h2>Art</h2>
<p>The last interest of mine that will be included here is art. I've been drawing as long as I could remember. I remember my sister and I drawing our own paper dolls when we didn't have
real ones. I remember the self portraits and the paintings I did in college. Where I was 14, I was <em>so</em> sure that I'd sing in a band. My cousins and I formed a group together,
and I filled a composition notebook with songs. They never got recorded professionally, but I just enjoyed the process of creating. To be able to imagine something in my mind, then draw, paint, sing
or write it down was such an amazing feeling. I can't say whether I was talented or not, but I didn't care. The feeling of being able to create and express myself freely was enough for me! I definitely
miss that feeling. As I've gotten older, and just experienced life, I've found in harder to have that spirit for carefree creation. The feeling of not caring whether it was good or not seems so foreign.
I'm hoping to get that feeling back someday! </p>


    <h2>Why MSIMBO?</h2>

    <p>Up until Septmber, I worked as an assistant manager at a restaurant until I was laid off from my job due to low sales caused by COVID-19. I took it really hard, and was unsure of what step
    I wanted to take next. I'd been in the food service business since 2012, and was ready for a change. I wanted to change fields, and learn something new. In my freetime, I actually built my own PC and
  became more interested in the way computers work. I also recently started using 'Blender', which is a 3D modeling application. It's been challenging,yet satisfying to learn. I feel like I've learned
all I can from my previous job, and I'm ready to move in a different direction that I feel could help me reach my goals of stability. I've been holding back, because I honestly do not have much coding
experience at all, but I'm willing to put the work and time in to learn!</p>
